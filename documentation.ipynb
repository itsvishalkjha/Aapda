    "# Disaster Management CNN Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Welcome to the Disaster Managements CNN Model. This model identifies rhinos in images captured by drones during floods, aiding animal rescue efforts. Here we have taken the situation of Floods in Kaziranga National Park of Assam, India and moreover we have only emphasized on One horned Rhinoceros which is one of the most important animals in the entire world due to its decreasing number and specific locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses a MobileNetV2 base and a custom head for rhino detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MobileNetV2 Base:**\n",
    "   - A pre-trained MobileNetV2 neural network for general image understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Head:**\n",
    "   - Designed to identify rhinos and distinguish safe zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synthetic images of flooded areas with rhinos and safe zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resize images to 224x224 pixels and normalize pixel values (Dependable as per our model , this requirement satisfies)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning Rate: 0.001\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Resizing:**\n",
    "   - Resize images to 224x224 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization:**\n",
    "   - Normalize pixel values for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Model:**\n",
    "   - Load the trained model into your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocess Input:**\n",
    "   - Prepare input images by resizing and normalizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make Predictions:**\n",
    "   - Use the model to make predictions on new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Post-processing (if applicable):**\n",
    "   - Implement any necessary post-processing steps on the model's output.\n",
